            <h3>Redesigned Local website</h3>
            <p>A hobby of mine is brewing and I noticed the website of my favorite vendor was a very basic website, I asked if I could redesign their website for free
                and this is the redesign I ended up on. This project used React.js along with bootstrap for a more modern look. 

            </p>
            

        </div>
